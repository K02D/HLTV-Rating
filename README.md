# HLTV-Rating-Breakdown

The HLTV Rating is the most reliable measure of a player's performance in the video game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. The HLTV rating is calculated using a number of statistics (kills, deaths, average damage per round, etc) but the exact formula or weightages are not disclosed to the public. I fit a model to predict a player's HLTV rating using these statistics, and use this accurate model to compute the relative importance of each factor.
